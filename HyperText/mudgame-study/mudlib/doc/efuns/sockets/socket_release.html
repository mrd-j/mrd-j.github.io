### NAME

    socket_release() - release ownership of a socket to another object

### SYNOPSIS

    #include <socket_err.h>

    int socket_release( int socket, object ob,
                        string release_callback );

### DESCRIPTION

    socket_release()  is used to change ownership (and control) of a socket
    to another object.  It is useful in daemon objects (like  inetd)  which
    handle  connection  set-up  and  then  transfer  a  connected socket to
    another object for further processing.

    Socket ownership transfer involves  a  handshake  between  the  current
    owner object and the socket to which the current owner wishes to trans‐
    fer the socket.  The handshake is initiated  when  socket_release()  is
    called.   socket_release() does appropriate security/integrity checking
    and then calls the release_callback function in object ob.  This  func‐
    tion is used to notify ob that socket ownership is being transferred to
    it.  It is then ob's responsibility to call socket_acquire() within the
    release  callback  function.   If  socket_acquire()  is called then the
    handshake is complete and socket ownership has been successfully trans‐
    ferred  to  ob.  ob may decline to accept responsibility for the socket
    by not calling socket_acquire(),  in  which  case  ownership  does  not
    change and the current socket owner must decide how to respond to this.

    If  the  socket  owner is successfully transfered then socket_release()
    returns EESUCCESS.  If ob does not accept ownership for the socket then
    EESOCKNOTRLSD is returned.  Other errors can be returned based on secu‐
    rity violation, bad socket descriptor vbalues, etc.
