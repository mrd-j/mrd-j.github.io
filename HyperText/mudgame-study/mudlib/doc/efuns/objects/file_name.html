### NAME

    file_name() - get the file name of an object

### SYNOPSIS

    string file_name( object ob );

### DESCRIPTION

    file_name()  returns  the  name of the file from which <ob> was loaded.
    If the object is a cloned object,  then  file_name()  will  not  be  an
    actual  file  on  disk, but will be the name of the file from which the
    object was originally cloned, appended with an octothorpe (#)  and  the
    object  instance  number.   Object instance numbers start at 0 when the
    game is booted, and increase by one for each object cloned,  hence  the
    number   is   unique   for   each  cloned  object.   <ob>  defaults  to
    this_object() if not specified.
