### NAME

    children() - returns an array of objects cloned from a given object.

### SYNOPSIS

    object *children( string name );

### DESCRIPTION

    This  efunction  returns an array of objects that have been cloned from
    the file named by 'name', as well  as  the  object  'name'  itself,  if
    loaded.   An example use of children() is to find all objects that have
    been cloned from the user object:

        object *list;

        list = children("/obj/user");

    This lets you find all users  (both  netdead  and  interactive  whereas
    users() only reports interactive users).
